Electrified Vehicle Library for Simulation and Optimisation

This is a library for the simulation of electric and hybrid vehicles. 
The focus for this libary is the energy efficiency of the powertrain,
the analysis of different cycles, and the visualisation of the results. 
It is inspired by the QSS library and by Advisor, and it combines 
backward and forward facing simulation.
